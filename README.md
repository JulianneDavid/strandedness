# strandedness
For analyzing RNA-seq data for stranded or unstranded experimental protocol.

Current code allows user to run code with .sam file input, and samples the file in preparation for parsing the sampled reads.

The min_reads section - which calculates the minimum number of reads that must be sampled to give high enough confidence in the final strandedness call - is UNDER CONSTRUCTION.  Don't trust the calculated standard deviation.
